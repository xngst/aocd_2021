Advent of Code is an online Advent calendar where a new puzzle is published every day from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle becomes available at midnight, US Eastern Time. An Advent of Code puzzle has a few typical characteristics:  

* Each puzzle consists of two parts, but the second part isn’t revealed until you finish the first part.  
* You’ll earn one golden star (⭐) for each part that you finish. This means you can earn two stars per day and fifty stars if you solve all the puzzles for one year.
* The puzzle is the same for everyone, but you need to solve it based on personalized input that you get from the Advent of Code site. This means that your answer to a puzzle will be different from someone else’s, even if you use the same code to calculate it.

The solutions have been validated on the Advent of Code platform: https://adventofcode.com
